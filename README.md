# Personal Coding Journey Website

This is a website created using an HTML5 UP template, combined with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. It features a personal restructure and tweaks to effectively display my self-taught journey in coding.

## Features

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Integration with Next.js for improved performance.
- Custom components styled with shadcn/ui.
- A personal narrative showcasing my coding journey and projects.

## Known Issues

- The original HTML5 UP template uses jQuery, which may conflict with React's rendering and event handling. If some animations are not working as expected, please reload the page.
