              Welcome to my journey! From self-taught coding to passions in

              I graduated from National Taiwan Ocean University with a
              bachelor&apos;s degree in marine engineering. I was previously
              recruited by Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp. as an{" "}
              <b>aircraft maintenance engineer</b>. However, due to the high
              risk of injury and limited career flexibility, I decided to
              explore a different field. I developed an interest in computer
              science, which I couldn&apos;t pursue in college due to my exam
              results. Now, I&apos;m on a self-taught journey to become a
              software engineer.

              I&apos;ve been self-taught for about three years, mainly focusing
              on fully understanding the courses I took. Starting with the
              basics of <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b>, I
              learned how to use tools like <b>VS Code</b>, the <b>terminal</b>,
              and <b>GitHub</b>. I then advanced to topics like{" "}
              <b>TypeScript</b> for type checking, <b>React</b> for front-end
              frameworks, the <b>MERN stack</b> for full-stack development, and{" "}
              <b>Next.js</b> as a modern approach to building apps. I believe
              that only after having a solid knowledge foundation can I
              contribute effectively in a real-world job under time pressure,
              while also quickly picking up new technologies when needed in the
              future.

            <p>
              During my school days, I developed a strong interest in{" "}
              <b>table tennis</b> and <b>gaming</b>. This passion motivated me
              to seek information online, which in turn improved my English
              reading and comprehension skills. I learned how to train
              effectively, stick to a plan, and work hard to achieve better
              performance in these hobbies. This pursuit has positively impacted
              my life in many ways, enhancing my physical fitness,
              concentration, and reflexes, as well as my mental skills in
              critical thinking, problem solving and handling pressure. When I
              hit a roadblock, I turn to additional resources like <b>books</b>{" "}
              and <b>podcasts</b> for guidance. Although my self-taught journey
              spans various topics, they all interconnect and evolve, much like
              a spider&apos;s web.

                          For me, gaming isn&apos;t just a hobbyâ€”it&apos;s a way

                          life balanced. Whether playing as a team member,
                          taking on the role of a <b>leader</b>, or acting as an{" "}
                          <b>executor</b> in high-pressure moments, gaming
                          offers a dynamic environment where I can sharpen my{" "}
                          <b>decision-making</b> and <b>adaptability</b>. Beyond
                          the game itself, it also serves as a social outlet,
                          allowing me to relax and enjoy meaningful
                          interactions, which help balance the demands of
                          everyday life.

                          observing how my opponent moves. I predict the
                          ball&apos;s curve based on its spin and speed, and
                          then decide how to respond while keeping my overall{" "}

                          seconds, I thrive on the challenge. This activity has
