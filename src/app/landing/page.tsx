              I graduated from National Taiwan Ocean University with a
              bachelor's degree in marine engineering. I was previously
              recruited by Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp. as an aircraft
              maintenance engineer. However, due to the high risk of injury and
              limited career flexibility, I decided to explore a different
              field. I developed an interest in computer science, which I
              couldn't pursue in college due to my exam results. Now, I'm on a
              self-taught journey to become a software engineer.

              I've been self-taught for about three years, mainly focusing on
              fully understanding the courses I took. Starting with the basics
              of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I learned how to use tools like VS
              Code, the terminal, and GitHub. I then advanced to topics like
              TypeScript for type checking, React for front-end frameworks, the
              MERN stack for full-stack development, and Next.js as a modern
              approach to building apps. I believe that only after having a
              solid knowledge foundation can I contribute effectively in a
              real-world job under time pressure, while also quickly picking up
              new technologies when needed in the future.

              I developed a strong interest in table tennis and gaming during my
              school days, and I found that when I'm passionate about something
              and want a deeper understanding, I need to actively seek
              information online. To excel in a competitive environment, I also
              need to know how to train effectively and stick to a plan while
              putting in hard work. Pursuing better performance in these hobbies
              has benefited my personal life in many ways, from physical aspects
              like fitness, concentration, and reflexes to mental areas like
              critical thinking, handling pressure, research, and data analysis.
              If I ever get stuck and can't find a way to improve, I turn to
              other resources like books and podcasts. Though my self-taught
              journey covers different topics, they all connect and grow like a
              spider web. Click the links below to explore more details.

                  environment where I can sharpen my decision-making and
                  adaptability. Beyond the game itself, it also serves as a
                  social outlet, allowing me to unwind and enjoy meaningful
                  interactions, which help balance the demands of everyday life.

                      League of Legends is a popular multiplayer online battle
                      arena (MOBA) game where players control champions with
                      unique abilities to engage in strategic 5v5 matches. Its
                      popularity meant that I could easily find four other
                      classmates to queue with during high school. As I spent
                      more time playing, I began to wonder whether I was simply
                      chasing the rush from winning games or if I was genuinely
                      learning something valuable. Although I have to admit it
                      provided a much-needed dopamine boost to balance the
                      pressure from the strict Asian education system, I still
                      found that I improved a lot in the aspect of{" "}

                      and provide useful information to help the team. Taking
                      responsibility for decisions, supporting teammates, and
                      having each other's back became practices I try to apply
                      beyond the game.

                      Overwatch, Apex Legends, and Valorant are popular
                      first-person shooter (FPS) games where players rely on
                      quick reflexes, precise aim, and sharp decision-making to
                      outplay their opponents. As I spent more time with these
                      games, I noticed how they sharpened my <b>reflexes</b>,
                      enhanced my concentration, and trained my ability to make
                      <b>micro-adjustments</b> during intense moments. Each game
                      demands constant <b>awareness of the surroundings</b> and
                      quick adaptation to shifting team strategies. Whether
                      switching between offensive and defensive roles or
                      executing split-second tactics, these FPS games taught me
                      to stay <b>focused</b>, <b>remain calm under pressure</b>,
                      and quickly adapt to new challenges. These experiences not
                      only honed my gaming skills but also helped me develop a
                      mindset that can be applied to real-life situations
                      requiring <b>precision</b> and{" "}
