          <p>
            At first, I wanted to create a site entirely on my own, but I soon
            realized that <b>design</b> and <b>UI/UX</b> are distinct topics
            separate from web development. I watched a few videos to get a basic
            understanding of the <b>Figma</b> design tool, but I still found it
            challenging and time-consuming to create a site from scratch by
            myself. So, I decided to use an open-source template as a starting
            point and combined it with what I had learned to ultimately build
            this site.
