            For me, gaming isn&apos;t just a hobbyâ€”it&apos;s a way to{" "}
            <b>
              <FlashingText>connect with people</FlashingText>
            </b>
            , build skills, and keep life balanced. Whether playing as a team
            member, taking on the role of a <b>leader</b>, or acting as an{" "}
            <b>executor</b> in high-pressure moments, gaming offers a dynamic

            <b>
              <FlashingText>decision-making</FlashingText>
            </b>{" "}
            and{" "}
            <b>

            allowing me to relax and enjoy meaningful interactions, which help
            balance the demands of everyday life.
